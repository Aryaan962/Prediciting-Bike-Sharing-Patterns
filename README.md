# Prediciting Bike Sharing Patterns
As part of a deep learning project, I developed this neural network model and taught it how to predict these patterns.

This code is based off learning bike-sharing patterns from months of data to extrapolate future patterns. This helps someone with a business in the bike-sharing industry to optimize the amount of money they can make.

The data that was trained was based on an hourly basis for almost a year and the prediction was used for the month of December. Because this is a holiday month, the prediction may look slightly off because the dataset was not large enough to reflect holidays.

Check out some of the code I developed and the model that I used to create the neural network.
